"""Owner notification for outbox commands that exhausted their retries.

A dead command is otherwise invisible to the owner: the work simply never
happens. One sanitized notice is enqueued into the conversation the command
belongs to, keyed on the command, so replays reuse the same outbound message.
Only what the owner can act on is said; the provider response, exception and
attempt history stay in the outbox record and the logs.

Owner reply delivery is deliberately excluded. If replies cannot reach the
conversation, a notice about the reply would fail the same way and enqueue
another notice.

The same anchoring serves the monthly cost ceiling: a transcription or review
command held back by the ceiling completes normally and the owner is told once,
in the case thread, that the limit is reached. Only units are ever mentioned,
never money.
