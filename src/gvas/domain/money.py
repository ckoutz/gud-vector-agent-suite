"""Exact money formatting.

Prices are carried as integer minor units everywhere, so rendering them must
stay integral too: ``amount_minor / 100`` would move an owner's price through a
binary float. How many minor units a major unit holds is a property of the
currency (USD has 100, JPY has 1), so a formatter cannot assume two decimals
either. Only the currencies this deployment can price are listed; an unknown
code is refused rather than formatted with a guessed exponent.
