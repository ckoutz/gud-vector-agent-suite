"""Outbox worker entrypoint.

Every provider call happens here rather than in the web request, so this
service must run continuously and separately from the web service. The loop
polls one batch at a time; SIGTERM and SIGINT stop it after the batch in flight
finishes, which leaves claimed rows to expire by lease rather than mid-command.
