"""Website booking intake: start a chat, collect the request, offer real
availability and route the pick to the owner.

The hard rule: nothing is booked until the owner replies ``approve booking
<ref>``. The service collects, proposes, and notifies — the booking itself is
an outbox command so provider calls stay retryable and never run inside the
request that saved the approval.

    The scheduling-link path cannot pin an exact time, so the webhook is the
    authority on what actually landed on the calendar: an event at the
    approved time confirms the booking, an event at a different time puts the
    request back in front of the owner for a fresh decision, and a
    cancellation closes the request. ``booked_event_uri`` is the processed
    marker — a redelivered event is ignored, and a later different event is
    applied on its own.
